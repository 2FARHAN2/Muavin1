An Aries is not weighed down by the freedom of choice, and is perhaps the sign that is least conflicted about what they want. They throw themselves at the world eagerly and without fear. It is one of their most commendable qualities, but also what causes them a great deal of pain and grief." +
                    "Aries are driven by a desire to prove themselves and their strength. They naturally take charge and are competitive and ambitious. Aries are spontaneous and courageous. They have a sense of adventure and love to explore. They’re determined and bold, and are good at initiating new projects. They have high energy and can initiate quick actions. They can also be impatient, but are naturally active and don’t like to waste time." +
                    "While Aries like competition, they don’t like to play games. They are highly self-aware, have strong opinions and are always ready to defend them."
            2 -> "Taureans are the human equivalent of moss. A handmade wooden chair. They are normally satisfied with the way things are. They embody stability. Sitting in a patch of grass admiring the breeze. When everything else seems to be falling apart, Taureans are an oasis of calm, a rock of dependability. Practical knowledge and experience is their modus operandi." +
                    "Taureans are oriented around the physical world. They tend to be grounded and logical. They love routine and they’re committed to their own comfort. They like to be in control. They’re patient and steady, and their materialism is an extension of their pursuit of stability." +
                    "Once they get into a groove, it’s difficult for them to get out of it. Object in motion stays in motion. Object at rest stays at rest. Appreciative of beauty. Attuned to physical pleasure. They like things to be predictable. They are perfectly happy eating the same meal over and over, or wearing the same outfit for a week straight. They would prefer things be consistent than chaotically good. They like to discover what they have the most fun doing, and then do it to the extreme." +
                    "Tauruses have a regal quality about them. They are graceful and diligent laborers. They can be stubborn, bull-headed, and set in their ways, but they are also great listeners and very dependable." +
                    "Taurus can absolutely go on forever. They never feel fatigued. They are like machines. And no matter what they throw at them, they will inevitably overcome their obstacles because they’ve already prepared for every contingency. They are the hand-built truck that will never break down. They are the bulletproof vest that never rips."
            3 -> "Geminis are very intelligent and pick up knowledge quickly. They are perceptive, analytical, and often very funny. They have an unreserved and childlike curiosity, always asking new questions." +
                    "Geminis have an uncanny ability to size up a person’s character in a matter of seconds, even if they only just met them. If someone’s bluffing, they’ll be the first to notice. They are great communicators, very responsive and sensitive listeners." +
                    "Geminis are versatile, comfortable being both introverts and extroverts. They are quick to adapt to the energy of a room. They can be the life of the party or a complete wallflower. They know how to bring dissimilar people together and make them get along."
            4 -> "A Cancer’s personality is like wading chest deep in a lake of warm water. It feels sparkling and cool while it’s touching the body, but you know that if you were to dive in, it would feel warm." +
                    "Cancer’s self-awareness is like the tides. They’re constantly moving in and out of focus. Their personality is layered. They have many moods, some of which are contradictory, but they also have a deep, core self that persists." +
                    "Cancers are weighed down by their own sorrows and the sorrows of those around them. They are frequently haunted by grief. It’s hard for them to share their pain with others, and they are often afraid to be vulnerable because they carry a fear that people will use their weaknesses against them. Cancers have learned to hide their pain to avoid burdening anyone else. They pretend they’re okay when they’re not." +
                    "Their emotions are like an exposed nerve. They can feel everything. They’re like a tuning fork that vibrates at the slightest provocation. They tend to carry deep grudges because they can’t forget the emotional sting of a slight."
            5 -> "Leos are bold, warm, and loving. They are also the ultimate showmen. They can dazzle with the theatrical flair of a Broadway star and the charisma of a politician. They are captivating personalities. They have a way with words, and can speak eloquently on just about any topic, no matter how quickly they’ve just been introduced to it." +
                    "Leos inject ambition into everything they do. They are ruled by the heart. They are brash and confident and trust their instincts. Their actions are natural and effortless." +
                    "Leos have an unrelenting appetite for growth that is easily satiated by the praise of others. When they are hurting, it shows. They will use their anger as a protective wall to shield their vulnerabilities. They want to be perceived as unbreakable because they are scared of admitting vulnerability, needing things from other people, being incomplete."
            6 -> "Virgos are known for being perfectionists. Clean freaks. They are known for their attention to detail. They can find patterns where there are none. They can be finicky and critical to a fault." +
                    "It’s true that Virgos are very particular, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they keep neat spaces. Their particularities and habits don’t necessarily line up with traditional views of cleanliness. They could live in what looks like a Tasmanian devil-style dust storm ruin, but still impose a “no shoes in the house” or “no outside clothes on the bed” rule. Maybe their house looks cluttered, but they still know where everything is. Everything has its place. Virgos prefer to exist in organized spaces, but put their service orientation over their own comfort. This can mean that a Virgo is too busy fixing the lives of those around them to put much work into providing for their own needs. They’re rarely motivated by their own self-interest." +
                    "Virgos are also known for being intelligent, but because of their introverted nature they can sometimes have trouble expressing themselves. Talking to them may feel like floating on the surface of existence, and like you never know what they’re thinking and feeling deep inside. Their emphasis on thoughts and ideas can seem like a cover-up for their lack of emotional depth. In reality, they are a fortress unto themselves—the definition of self-containment. Virgos will be endlessly accepting of whatever you have to share, but may not see the value in spontaneously performing a similar excavation of themselves for anyone else."
            7 -> "Libras are difficult to really understand because they seem so contradictory on the surface. They’re simultaneously extroverted and introverted, strategic and spontaneous, focused and intuitive. This variability makes it difficult to pin down their true character. They are an entire constellation of personalities. Libras are different depending on who they're around." +
                    "This is because Libras value empathy. They are receptive. They can be other people’s mirrors. Because of this, they have strong opinions about other people, but take a long time to understand themselves." +
                    "They want to be admired not for their talents but for their charm. They want to be seen as the responsible figure who can balance out the turbulent elements around them. They feel an intense amount of guilt and shame when they are unhappy because they know that their unhappiness affects everyone around them."
            8 -> "The Scorpio personality is a profound chasm of infinite complexity (or at least how they project themselves). They are difficult people to get to know. They are psychological trap doors. They socialize from behind a double-sided mirror, always scanning, reading you while you can only see your own reflection. They prefer to be the people asking the questions. They remove your skin with their perceptive scalpel and take inventory of your pulsing viscera. They probe and push. They know the little things that make you tick. Your pressure points. The subtle ways to procure the answer they’re seeking. They are keenly aware of power, its flows, and their position within its matrix." +
                    "Despite their ability to be generally popular, there’s something very lonely about Scorpios. They have a ruthless view of the world. Eat or be eaten. Every human interaction is a meeting of opposing powerful forces. A clashing of wants and needs where somebody wins and somebody loses. Their knowledge of other people’s internal structures gives them an edge over the competition. They know how to play people against each other. They are forthcoming and evasive at the same time, depending on what is situationally beneficial. They are blunt, but not tactlessly so. They are intentional about the information they reveal. They’re not liars, they do not espouse falsehoods, but they are masters of opening windows on certain truths while concealing others behind heavy curtains."
            9 -> "Sagittarius is the ultimate empiricist. They will always choose principles over feelings and will often question who they are. They move from job to job, philosophy to philosophy, belief to belief. They are explorers of the human condition and are unafraid of change. Sagittarians feel like the world is their playground. They love to explore the unknown. They want to understand how the world works." +
                    "On an unbounded quest to discover the whole of the universe inside of themselves, Sagittarians are unshackled from any particular worldly attachment. They are reckless in their pursuit of what they want, and often end up doing and experiencing things that defy conceptions of the possible." +
                    "Sagittarius is an explorer. They are both the fearless adventurer and the jaded critic. They understand that knowledge comes in two forms: the shallow, disposable kind that comes from external sources, and the kind that comes from within. Sagittarius knows that external knowledge can be easily gained while internal knowledge is exponentially deeper and more powerful. They’re on a quest to delve into the depths of the universe inside the human mind. They don’t do this to prove that they have all the answers, but instead because they know that the journey is the destination."
            10 -> "Capricorns are masters of discipline. The wringing of the hands, the constant reminders, the exacting structure, the ever-increasing goals, the tidal wave of self-criticism that lasts forever. They are the ultimate perfectionist. They can be so absorbed in their own internal monologue that it becomes impossible to get them to look away from themselves. Capricorns are often called “workaholics.”" +
                    "They are incredibly pragmatic. They are rule followers with a highly developed moral compass. From a young age it is impressed upon them that their whole sense of worth and meaning is based on their ability to hunker down and force their way to the finish. This turns them into achievement junkies. Their drive to succeed is a reflection of their fear of failure. The most stressful time in a Capricorn’s life is when they question their own authority. When a Capricorn is in a position of power, they are most stable. When they’re put in a position where they have to cater to someone else’s agenda, they can become a little unhinged."
            11 -> "Aquarians are archetypical outcasts. This doesn’t mean they’re loners. In fact, they thrive in large groups—charming you with their peculiar senses of humor, intriguing you with fun facts about the history of disposable straws, or convincing you to join their reading group. The alienation they feel is often self-imposed—a result of their knee-jerk contrarianism, rather than a lack of social intelligence. They try to be weird. They hang grapefruit rinds from the wall and call it art, they pretend to actually like noise music, they saturate their internal monologues with SAT words." +
                    "Aquarians are always running little tests. They live their lives as one big science experiment, using the element of surprise to collect reactions and construct theories about the intricacies of human nature. They are walking abstract art pieces, shattering traditional perspectives with their complete disregard for convention. They are martyrs to the cause of “humanity”, and “freedom” is their only demand."
            12 -> "Describing a Pisces’ personality can be difficult because Pisces tend to evade distinction. Their behavior changes significantly based on who they’re around. Pisces are just permeable membranes that pensively let things flow through them. They are cerebral sea sponges. They are boundless. They tend to dilute themselves with larger personalities to avoid having to form coherent identities." +
                    "Most of the qualities usually associated with Pisces (dreaminess, emotionality, imagination) are internal processes that are difficult to observe from the outside. This is because Pisces are primarily inward-facing. They are not self-absorbed, but they are absorbed in themselves." +
                    "Ultimately, a Pisces wants to dissolve. To wrest themselves of a physical form and diffuse into everything they touch as love. To exist in the gossamer liminal layer that hangs just barely above the material. To live their life like a romantic poem. To understand that reality and fantasy are neighbors on the same infinite plane."

An Aries-Aries relationship is like looking into a mirror: Aries understands their partner’s need for independence because they’re the same way. At times, however, they can be possessive and turn into two Rams butting heads. They have to learn not to compete with one another so much. If they can do so, their partnership can be extremely powerful.\n" +

                    "An Aries-Aries love match is a meeting of two strong spirits; generally, the relationship is positive and enthusiastic. They love to try new things — often extreme sports or some other intense activity. Solving the inevitable problems of a close relationship can be tough due to the two egos constantly clashing. They must learn to work together. Since both partners like things to go their way, they must make a conscious effort not to be selfish. Aries also has a natural generosity, however, so two Aries together can certainly learn to take turns indulging each other. Aries is very open with their feelings; totally straightforward, two Aries will never have problems with deceit or hypocrisy. Both partners will have trouble with temper outbursts that result from hasty judgments. Aries just wants to get on with it, already!."

This can create a problem; Taurus loves to be wooed and romanced — two concepts that are basically foreign to straightforward, brash, totally unsubtle Aries. An Aries-Taurus partnership can be a great learning experience for both Signs. Taurus can help Aries rein in some of the more foolish, impractical impulses, and Aries can help Taurus be more spontaneous and adventurous.\n" +

Taurus sees Aries as possessing that quality they want more of — knowing when and how to grab on to life’s opportunities. These Signs are a good balance for each other. Aries might sometimes play games with Taurus, playing off that Bullish laziness, or try to push Taurus into making hasty decisions, but the Bull can usually convince the Ram to slow down a bit. Aries brings excitement to the relationship, while Taurus brings security and romance. When Aries wants instant gratification, Taurus can show just how sexy and sensual slow, deliberate movement can be.\n"

Signs that are two apart in the Zodiac usually enjoy excellent communication and a deep understanding of one another. Aries’s independent, pioneering spirit is attractive to Gemini, who also values independence. If Gemini feels that Aries is being too controlling or if Aries takes Gemini’s flirtatious nature too seriously, arguments may set the tone of the relationship. They create a good balance together: Aries wants to experience things and Gemini wants to discuss them. Together they can make all kinds of new discoveries that they might have missed alone.\n" +

Gemini is a thinker and a talker, prizes intellectual stimulation and freedom and loves to look at all sides of an argument. Aries loves to jump into new projects and get their hands dirty, and Gemini will definitely take the time to find out Aries’s reasons for choosing the projects they support. While Gemini can be wishy-washy, Aries is straightforward and decisive; this is a great combination, but it is essential that Aries allows Gemini intellectual space."

Aries can certainly be emotional — in a fiery, impetuous way that can completely overwhelm Cancer. Even though Cancer usually likes to take time with relationships, Aries’s whirlwind approach can be extremely stimulating. Aries, on the other hand, may find the Cancerian sensitivity appealing; it’s a good balance for the typical Aries bluntness. Troubles may arise if Cancer’s mood swings or Aries’s aggression becomes hurtful. Both Signs must take time to listen to their partner’s needs and understand that they’re coming from different directions to meet a common goal.\n" +

                    "Cancer is the Sign of Home while Aries is the Sign of Self. One great dynamic between these two is that both Signs are extremely protective of those they love. Cancer uses that Crab shell to draw around themselves and their family and mate when trouble is near, while the Ram uses their strength and bravery, like a knight in shining armor. Cancer also provides Aries with a happy domestic life and emotional security. Sometimes they might build an idealized image of their Aries partner or be overly possessive, which can really grate on independent Aries. However, Aries can help by reassuring their Cancer partner that they are loved and cherished. Aries really needs to learn to listen to Cancer: the Crab operates on an instinctive level and their advice can help Aries avoid making silly mistakes caused by that typical Aries lack of planning."

Leo likes to be adored and their egos to be stroked, services which easily-bored Aries may not want to provide. Aries may also be bothered by Leo’s flirtatious nature — but this relationship is always exciting. Despite their sometimes noisy differences, Aries often looks to Leo as a guide or counselor. Leo is the Lion and, with Leo, Aries can be the lamb. As in the myth (The Lion and the Lamb), any differences between these two can be overcome.

Aries’s energy is fiery and impetuous while Virgo’s is much slower and more grounded. It’s these very differences, however, that can teach Aries and Virgo so much, once they just look beneath one another’s surfaces to see what lies beneath.\n" +

But if they focus on one another’s strengths instead, they’ll discover a great deal. Aries teaches Virgo about fun and excitement, about the spontaneity that is often missing in Virgo’s life. Virgo teaches Aries patience and attention to detail, the knowledge that the little things — and moments — are important too. Aries can teach their Virgo lover to take things less seriously. Virgo can teach Aries to be polite and value hard work."

Aries is the Sign of Self while Libra is the Sign of Partnership, and the differences continue: Aries is impulsive, excitable and ready to jump right into something new and exciting, while Libra is indecisive, peace-loving and prefers a calm, smooth approach. Aries can learn from Libra that their own way isn’t necessarily the best way.\n" +

At the same time, though this pair’s connection is amazing when it’s good, it can be extremely challenging when it’s bad. All polarities have energies that tend to tangle or knot if understandings can’t be reached. As a combination, Aries and Libra are well-balanced. Charming, cultured Libra can teach brash Aries something about style. Libra prizes harmony in a relationship and will go to great lengths to maintain it.

Scorpio tends to be more patient, but is also more possessive than Aries — and can lash out (with that Scorpion sting!) when their feelings get hurt. Despite their differences in emotional involvement, both partners love risk and taking chances; this is not a boring relationship! Aries and Scorpio can have lots of adventures together. They may have trouble understanding one another — Aries is a true extrovert, totally up-front and open, while Scorpio is more inward, emotional and, at times, manipulative.

They do need to be careful, however: This could be an accident-prone relationship as Aries is always in a rush and Sagittarius tends to look at everything but the obvious. Also, as much as these two have in common, it may be difficult to maintain a long-term relationship when both parties have so much energy to start new things — but not much interest in following through.\n" +

                    "Aries and Sagittarius make great friends as well as lovers. They truly understand one another’s optimistic view of life. Problems are rare, but Sagittarius has an even greater need for independence than does Aries, who can sometimes be overly possessive. Aries is also a bit more sensitive than the fun and flirty Archer; Sagittarius can tend to put their foot in their mouth, so to speak, by speaking without thinking. The good thing is, both Signs are able to forgive and forget fast. They don’t have time to spend holding a grudge!."

Aries moves fast and, to Capricorn, at least, seems to risk it all. Capricorn abhors unnecessary risk. They move at a slower pace, working inexhaustibly toward well-defined goals (usually related to career or other forms of public advancement). Both partners always get where they’re going, only in different ways — and usually where they’re going is totally different, too!.\n" +

They’re both very stubborn and think their way is best, so in order to work together, they have to agree to disagree. Their philosophies are very different: Aries looks for the shortcut while Capricorn wants to follow the rules, assuming they’re a tried-and-true path to success. How does this manifest itself in a romantic relationship. Aries is all about impetuous, passionate pursuit of the one they want, without stopping to think whether the one they’ve chosen is really the right one for them. Capricorn, on the other hand, likes to analyze how much a potential love partner will be able to help them advance in life, and will use that as the basis of their decision of whether or not to pursue the relationship. If these two can meet and get together, however, they can teach one another things they wouldn’t learn on their own."

Aries loves how unique Aquarius is, their inventive vision of the world; Aquarius loves Aries for their energy and initiative — Aquarius gets new ideas all the time but sometimes finds it hard to carry them out. Since both Signs prize independence, Aries’s tendency toward possessiveness can push Aquarius to become aloof or detached as a self-preservation tactic. Though they have that special connection, they do see the world in very different lights, which they both need to understand. Aries can be too involved for Aquarius’s taste, and Aquarius in turn may be too unpredictable for Aries. As it turns out, Aquarius is the one Sign that has Aries beat when it comes to spontaneity! As long as both partners reassure each other that the relationship is important and secure, things will be just fine."

On the surface an Aries and a Pisces may seem an unlikely pair, but when there’s love involved, they can truly fulfill one another’s needs. Pisces is very intuitive, both as a person and as a lover; Aries must take care to return this favor so Pisces won’t begin to see their Aries partner as stingy and selfish.\n" +

When the ‘prey’ is gentle Pisces, Aries tends to take on the role of protector. The funny thing is, Pisces is the real protector, as the intuitive, deeply understanding partner who provides a relaxing sort of refuge for hectic Aries. Pisces is a Water Sign; they can fill any container, so to speak. They are so giving and empathetic that sometimes they can become something of a doormat — they give themselves completely to their partners, and if their partner can’t do the same, trouble may result. Pisces understands Aries in a deeper way than most other Signs do, so this can help alleviate this type of problem: Pisces knows how to keep Aries from becoming overly brash or rash. Together they form a dynamic team when they combine Aries’s directness with Pisces’s intuitive understanding of other people."

They love the wooing process of courting, so the beginning, building stages of their relationship may stretch out deliciously. Taureans rarely rush into a relationship, but once they’re committed, it’s solid — maybe even for life. When two Taureans get together, both provide and expect total devotion. Because of this devotion, a Taurus-Taurus pair may be more possessive of each other than most. Nothing upsets these lovers more than infidelity, but — luckily — because both partners are so dedicated to each other and the relationship and because Taureans tend to be very reliable, cheating is rare."

Theirs is often the ideal family that people of other Signs strive for, with strong ties between them and a relationship that is family-oriented rather than toward the outside world.

These two Signs have much in common: They highly value common sense and practicality; they’re both materialistic but work hard for the creature comforts they so enjoy. Taurus is more sensual and indulgent than Virgo is; Virgo tends to be the inhibitive force in the relationship, tending not to get involved in the chaos of life in favor of analyzing all available options. Virgo’s analysis leads to criticism, which Taurus can tend to take too seriously. Conversely, Taurus’s stubborn nature can get on Virgo’s nerves, causing Virgo to criticize even more!
